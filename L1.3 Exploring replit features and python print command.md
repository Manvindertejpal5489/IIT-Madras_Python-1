## Revisiting the `print()` Command

### Printing Multiple Messages
```python
print("Hello India", "Hello World", "Hi Python Students")
```
- Prints all strings in the same line in the order they are listed

### Printing Numbers
```python
print(10)
print(20.5)
```
- Prints whole numbers and floating-point numbers

### Mixing Strings and Numbers
```python
print("Hello India", 10, 20.5)
```
- Combines different data types in a single print statement

## Common Mistakes with the `print()` Command

### Incorrect Function Name
```python
prnt("Hello")  # ‚ùå Typo in function name
```

### Wrong Type of Brackets
```python
print["Hello"]  # ‚ùå Square brackets
print{"Hello"}  # ‚ùå Curly brackets
print<"Hello">  # ‚ùå Angular brackets
```
- ‚úÖ Correct usage:
```python
print("Hello")
```

### Missing Quotes for Strings
```python
print(Hello)  # ‚ùå Error: string must be in quotes
```

### Valid Use of Quotes
```python
print("Hello")  # ‚úÖ Double quotes
print('Hello')  # ‚úÖ Single quotes
```
- üö´ Do not mix single and double quotes

### Syntax in Programming
- Syntax refers to the rules of writing code correctly in a programming language
- Python:
  - Strict about bracket types
  - Flexible with quote types (but must match opening and closing)
