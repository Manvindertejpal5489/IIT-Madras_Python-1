# L1.2: Introduction to Replit

## Writing Your First Program

### Ease of Programming Today

Programming has become significantly easier in recent years, especially by 2021, due to:

- Online tools  
- No need for software installation to get started

### Using Replit for Online Coding

1. Open a browser and go to [Replit.com](https://replit.com)  
2. Click on **Start Coding**  
3. Log in using your Gmail ID  
4. Click the **plus (+)** symbol to start a new project  
5. Select **Python** as the language  
6. Rename the project (e.g., `first_code`)  
7. Click **Create Repl**

> This creates a repository (a space to code). Ignore the term 'repository' for now—it simply means a place where you can write and run code.

### Writing a Simple Program

Type and run:

```python
print("hello")
```

**Output:**
```
hello
```

You can modify the content inside the quotes:

```python
print("Namaste")
print("Namaste India")
print("This is the second line.")
```

Each `print()` command displays text in the output pane. The output reflects exactly what you type.

## Creating Visual Patterns with Code

### Star Pattern - Staircase Effect

Type and run:

```python
print("*")
print("**")
print("***")
print("****")
```

**Output:**
```
*
**
***
****
```

This creates a staircase pattern with stars.

### Extending the Pattern

```python
print("*****")
print("******")
print("*******")
```

> ⚠️ Note: If you type 10 stars instead of 9, the computer will follow your instruction exactly, not what you intended. Computers follow instructions **literally**.

### Custom Output Example

```python
print("I don't know what to type")
```

**Output:**
```
I don't know what to type
```

## Introduction to Logic and Complexity

### Reverse Staircase Pattern

To print a reverse staircase pattern:

```python
print("  *")
print(" **")
print("***")
```

**Output:**
```
  *
 **
***
```

> This gives an inverted alignment. But:
> - Adding a 4th line requires adjusting previous lines.
> - It gets more complex as the number of lines increases.

### Observations

- Reverse patterns need careful spacing.
- Manually adjusting spaces becomes harder with more lines.

### Challenge Introduced

> **Can we automate this pattern creation?**

This leads to an upcoming topic:

- Using **loops and logic** in Python to **automate repetitive tasks**
- Instead of manually coding 20 lines, we will learn to generate such output with 3–4 lines of smart code
