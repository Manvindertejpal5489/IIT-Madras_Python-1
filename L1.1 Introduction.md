# L1.1 Introduction 

### Understanding Programming

#### What is Programming?
Programming is essentially about communicating with a computer. Just as we need to learn German to speak in Germany or French in France, to interact with a computer, we must learn a programming language.

#### Why Programming?
Programming allows us to instruct a computer to perform tasks. The need arises from the requirement to make a computer do complex tasks quickly and accurately.

#### Analogy with Human Languages
- Just as multiple languages are spoken around the world, there are numerous programming languages in computer science.
- To be effective in computer communication, learning a programming language is essential.

### Choice of Python as a Programming Language

#### Why Python?
1. **Widely Used**: Python is one of the most spoken languages in computing today.
2. **Ease of Learning**: Python is simple and intuitive, making it suitable for beginners.
3. **Powerful**: Despite being easy to learn, Python is capable of handling complex operations.

#### Evolution of Programming Learning
- Earlier languages like Pascal, COBOL, C, and C++ required weeks to months to become proficient.
- With Python, beginners can start coding effectively within hours.

### Learning Approach in This Course

#### Starting From the Basics
- No prior knowledge of computer science is assumed.
- Only basic understanding of English is required.
- Programming will start from the very first session.

#### Learning by Doing
- Like learning to drive, programming requires hands-on practice.
- Reading theory alone is insufficient; actual coding is necessary.
- Learners are encouraged to code alongside the instructors.

### The Fun Aspect of Programming

#### Why Programming is Fun?
- You get to make the computer do complex things.
- Tasks that are hard for humans can be performed by computers in a fraction of a secondâ€”sometimes at speeds comparable to sound or light.

#### Key Elements of Programming:
1. **Communication with the Computer**
2. **Executing Complex Operations**
3. **Achieving High Speed**

### Course Structure and Expectations

#### Hands-on Coding
- Programming sessions will involve live coding using a terminal.
- Instructors will explain each line of code and its output.

#### Pace of the Course
- The first week will be simple and slow-paced.
- Code will not exceed half a page per session.
- The initial pace may seem repetitive or slow for those familiar with programming, but it will gradually pick up.

#### Call to Action
- Learners should keep their terminal open and code along with the sessions.
- This approach ensures effective and practical learning.
