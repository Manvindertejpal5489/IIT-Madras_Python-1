# Understanding Variables and Input in Python

## The Basics of `print()` and Variable Assignment

```python
print(10)  # Prints the number 10 directly
```

### Using Variables
```python
a = 10
print(a)  # Prints the value assigned to variable 'a'
```

### Assigning and Printing Multiple Variables
```python
a = 10
b = 20
print(a)  # Output: 10
print(b)  # Output: 20
```

### Performing Arithmetic with Variables
```python
print(a + b)     # Output: 30
print(a * b)     # Output: 200
```

## Understanding `a = a + 1`

```python
a = 10
print(a)         # Output: 10
a = a + 1
print(a)         # Output: 11
```

- This is known as **incrementing** a variable.
- You can increment multiple times:

```python
a = a + 1
print(a)         # Output: 12
a = a + 1
print(a)         # Output: 13
```

## Using `input()` to Get User Input

```python
print("Enter a number")
n = int(input())
```

- This asks the user to **enter a number**.
- `input()` gets the value as a string.
- `int()` converts it to an integer.

### Displaying the Input and Operations on It

```python
print(n)           # Displays the number entered
print(n + 1)       # Displays next number
print(n + 2)       # Displays two steps ahead
print(n + 3)       # Displays three steps ahead
```

### Sample Output Flow

If the user enters:
```
100
```
The output will be:
```
100
101
102
103
```

### Clarifying the `int()` Function
- `input()` returns a string
- `int()` converts the string to an integer
- This is necessary for performing arithmetic
